## üìã Project Overview

**Traffic Bot** is a Tello-based project designed to detect passing cars using drone technology. The system utilizes a DJI Tello drone in combination with computer vision to monitor and identify vehicular traffic in real time.

## üéØ Project Purpose

The **Traffic Bot** project is an innovative software and hardware solution designed to alleviate street traffic congestion in **Downtown Birmingham**. Traffic congestion is a persistent issue in this area due to ongoing construction, car accidents, and peak-hour traffic.

While current solutions provide navigation assistance, they lack the capabilities to deliver **real-time, highly accurate alerts**. The goal of this project is to develop an **autonomous drone system** that can scan and analyze traffic patterns within city blocks.

The drone uses **machine learning** to detect vehicles and has the potential to recognize traffic incidents such as car accidents through **police light detection**. The system processes and outputs **real-time traffic updates** to users through a compatible **graphical user interface (GUI)**, empowering them to make more informed travel decisions.

This project has **real-world applications** and proposes a **corporate and business strategy** for innovation in traffic management across metro areas. By leveraging machine learning, **Traffic Bot** aims to revolutionize transportation and significantly reduce congestion, representing a major step toward a more efficient, data-driven approach to traffic management in Birmingham.
